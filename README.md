## üöÄ Running the FastAPI Server

1. **Start the server**:  
   To start the FastAPI backend, run the `start.sh` script:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Default port**:  
   The server will run on port `5000` by default. You can access the following endpoints in your browser:

   - **Swagger UI**:  
     [http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs) - Interactive API documentation.
   
   - **ReDoc UI**:  
     [http://127.0.0.1:5000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:5000/redoc) - Detailed API documentation.
   
   - **Root Endpoint**:  
     [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) - The main server endpoint.

3. **Change the port** (optional):  
   If you'd like to change the default port (5000), update the `start.sh` script or specify the port manually when starting the server:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh --port <custom_port>
   ```

### Key Points:

1. **Tailored Furniture Recommender System**: We use various AI techniques and metrics for recommending furniture as per the user's preference as well as the suitability to the selected area 
2. **AR Foundation and ARCore**: Unity setup with AR Foundation and ARCore for building augmented reality experiences.
3. **Swagger UI**: The FastAPI app automatically generates Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs` for interactive API testing.
4. **ReDoc**: For more detailed API documentation, ReDoc is available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/redoc`.
5. **Port Configuration**: The default port is `5000`, but it can be changed by passing a custom port argument when running the server.

This `README.md` should help users quickly set up and run the project, as well as provide details on the FastAPI server and Unity setup for ARCore.
